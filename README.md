# Product Studio (TECH 5900)

# What is the Product Challenge?
Every fall in the Studio, leading startups, companies, and organizations pose product challenges to Cornell Tech students. These challenges, in the form of a "How might we..?" question, go beyond a problem to solve or work to be done. Students across seven Master’s programs work in cross-disciplinary teams, conduct user research, create a strategy, and develop and test prototypes of a new product or service that responds to the challenge.

# What has happened so far?

The Studio team and faculty have spent the last three months working with more than 115 companies to solicit “How might we…?” questions for your Product Challenge in Product Studio. We received more than 185 submissions and narrowed it down to the most interesting and challenging projects!

# What can I expect at Orientation?

MONDAY, AUGUST 20TH:
You’ll get a brief introduction to the Studio team and learn all about the Studio code and culture. 
That evening you will receive an email with a list of all of the challenges to consider. You should spend some time reading over all of the challenges and think about which ones are interesting to you and why. The Program Directors for your program have indicated which challenges they highly recommend for their coursework. The companies who submitted the challenges will not be listed on this initial list of challenges. We want you to consider the challenge itself, and the impact you could have by working on that challenge.
We know you’ll have questions. Don’t worry, we’ll go over everything on Tuesday during the Studio activity and we hope to answer many of your open questions at that time. There will also be plenty of time for Q&A! 

TUESDAY, AUGUST 21ST: 
You will participate in a fun and immersive Studio exercise in New York City to get you thinking like a product developer. When you return from your excursion, you’ll have a chance to discuss the challenges in groups to explore them further.
After “Cornell Tech’s Got Talent” that evening, you will receive a survey asking you to rank your top ten challenges in order of preference. Participation in this survey is required. The surveys will be due on Friday at 11:59pm. 
The survey will list the companies that posed each challenge. While this may change how you choose to rank the challenges, we hope that the content of the challenge itself will be the primary factor in your decision-making. 




FRIDAY, AUGUST 24TH:
Surveys are due no later than 11:59pm. Students who do not turn in surveys will be randomly matched to a team. There will be no opportunity to change your selections once you have submitted your survey.

SUNDAY, AUGUST 26TH:
The Studio team will run DreamTeam, an algorithm built by Cornell Tech alumni, that will create the Product Challenge teams that you’ll work on for the fall semester and match you with a challenge. The algorithm will take into account your background, skills, and program, optimizing for your preferences and multi-disciplinary teams. Teams will consist of 4-5 students.

MONDAY, AUGUST 27TH:
You will meet your challenge teams and find out which challenge you matched to!

TUESDAY, AUGUST 28TH: 
Companies will be informed whether or not their challenge matched to a student team.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6TH:
We will host a Kickoff Breakfast for Company Advisors. You will have the opportunity to send a representative from your team to meet your Company Advisor if they are able to attend. 



FAQS
Q: What types of companies can submit challenges?
...
A: We encourage all leading startups, companies, and organizations from across the globe to submit a challenge. However, the selected Company Advisor should have enough bandwidth to engage with the students on a monthly basis.
...
Q: How many challenges can a company submit?
...
A: We generally limit submissions to one per company. Large corporations can submit one challenge per business unit.
...
Q: Are challenges guaranteed to be selected?
...
A: No. After the submission deadline, each challenge is reviewed internally. Some challenges will not move past this review stage.
Once all challenges are reviewed, a matching algorithm will connect students with challenges, optimizing for student interests.
About 45% of final challenges will match with student teams.


Q: Is there any cost to participate?
...
A: If your challenge matches with a student team, there is a suggested $2,500 fee to help defer the cost of operating Cornell Tech's unconventional Studio, which includes professional teamwork coaching support for students, new materials for projects such as the latest digital devices, training for practitioner teachers, events such as monthly Sprints and practitioner Crits, and more. For nonprofits and early stage startups this fee may be waived.


Q: Are there more examples of “How might we...?” challenges that matched with student teams from previous semesters?
...
A: Yes! To view examples of previous challenges, take a look at our Buildboard here: http://bit.ly/2E2aI1a ...


Q: What is the relationship between the companies and student teams?
...
A: Product Challenges are not work for hire or internships, but real-world learning opportunities for academic credit. Through iterative product development, student teams may pivot from an original idea to best address the challenge, or even reframe the challenge itself. The Company Advisors are not meant to influence product development, but rather serve as domain experts and mentors.


Q: How is Intellectual Property (IP) handled?
A: The primary purpose of the project is the education of the student. Organizations and students should define projects that are learning experiences and expose students to real-world challenges and opportunities within the organization. The ownership of any intellectual property (IP) that may be created during the project is public domain. The project is for educational purposes and any resulting intellectual property is openly shared for public benefit. IP, along with other legal matters, including confidentiality, pertaining to the project, are agreed upon at the outset of the project using the Cornell Standard Project (CSP) agreement. Companies that are matched with a team agree to use the CSP without modifications or revisions.
